## About BFD
BFD is a blog system whose primary target audience is front-end developers. It should be a flexible system that dynamically determines the CMS necessary to manage a particular page based on a schema contract with the theme applied to a post or a page.

More detailed plans can be found in the [product description](./productDescription.md).
